Alpha project structure - generated
To use:
1) Unzip into your Godot projects folder.
2) Open project.godot with Godot 4.x
3) Register 'scripts/systems/inventory.gd' and 'scripts/systems/network.gd' as Autoload singletons named Inventory and Network.
4) Open 'scenes/world.tscn' as main scene, run.
Notes: scenes are minimal placeholders; scripts implement core logic for mobs, NPCs, settlements, and combat. Replace placeholder meshes with real glb assets for visuals.


Added: UI scenes (HUD, inventory window, craft window), materials placeholders, environment scene, and demo world that spawns a player, a mob and a crate.
